# Welcome

Main repository for the Internal CRM task.

## Installation

This is the bundle for the internal CRM task containing the client and the server. We suggest that you fork the repository into your account and then use that for development.

## To run the client.

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the root of the project.

```
cd client
npm i
npm run dev
```

## To run the server.

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the root of the project.

```
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Notes:
1. The server contains two auto generated files for logging purposes:
   - `uncaughtExceptions.log` (contains any raised exceptions)
   - `logfile.log` 

## Guidelines for writing a commit message when publishing any changes.

- Create: `[commit message]` (create a new functionality)
- Add: `[commit message]` (addition to an existing functionality)
- Fix: `[commit message]` (fix a bug within an existing functionality)
- Refactor: `[commit message]` (refactor an existing functionality)
